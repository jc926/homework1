<h1> Hi Everyone, welcome to my simple, ugly, first pagedesign </h1>

<h2> <b>Jie Cai</b> </h2>
<ul>
	<li> <b>Introduction </b> </li>
		<blockquote> My name is <b><i>Jie Cai</i></b>.I was born in a mountain village in the middle of China, called Hubei Province.  I have a bachelor degree in Marketing in China. In 2014, I came to US and studied at Hofstra University, NY, to get my master degree in Market Research.Hence, I tried to apply a PhD in IS with little data experience. Finally I received the offer in August and arrived here in time. This is my first semester.  </blockquote>

	<li> <b>Experience </b></li>
		<blockquote> No experience in programing, To be honest, I am a marketing people with no IS background or coding experience.  My working experience motivated me to learn more about this area. I only took two classes (database management principle and data mining) at graduation level in 2016. After graduation from Hofstra, I took a full-time position as a merchandising assistant in the New York office of the third largest e-commerce business in China. </blockquote>
	
	<li> <b> Goal </b> </li>
		<blockquote>To me, learning new things and conducting research is truly enjoyable. I really enjoyed the time I spent with professors and students on campus with abundant resources and good facilities, learning new information and exchanging ideas and opinions. Undeniably, compared with farm work and the tough experience, conducting research and writing papers is really comfortable and fulfilling. In the future, I hope I can keep doing research in a research institution, on the one hand, to enjoy the freedom and challenge of academic journey , and on the other hand, to help other students.</blockquote>
